# mistakes I made
 - I forgot main element in html
 - Footer was outside the body element ,however it should have been inside the body 
 - I used margin property to center a div vertically while the best practice was to use postion, top and transform properties
 - I forgot to use ID attributes within html elements

# What I learnt
 - Never name a class with its value
 - some elements will have a defult value for margin property such as p element
 - img element can use block as a value for display property **(This mkes you able to center the img in the div elemet or reposition it)**
 - do not use colors names use color codes instead like hsl, hexa or RGB
